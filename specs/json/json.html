<p>
This document specifies a provenance representation in JSON, called PROV-JSON, for the W3C's Provenance Data Model (PROV-DM).</p>
</section> 
   
<section> 
<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p> PROV-JSON is a JSON representation for the Provenance Data Model (PROV-DM). The representation was developed internally at the University of Southampton as a common format for exchanging provenance information in web applications between research projects. At the same time, the PROV-JSON representation aims at facilitating client-side manipulations of provenance information and allowing the use of a generic client-side API in various web applications. Since it is based on the Provenance Data Model [[PROV-DM]] being standardized at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/">W3C Provenance Working Group</a>, it is hoped that the PROV-JSON representation will also benefit, and find support from, a wider community.</p>

<p>Note: The PROV-JSON mappings introduced later in this document were defined based specifically on <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/file/398ecd23ada1/model/ProvenanceModel.html">this version of PROV-DM</a>. As the PROV-DM document evolves, changes there will be incorporated back into this document at a later version. However, in the meantime, the readers should be aware that there might be misalignments between this document and the latest version of PROV-DM.</p>

<h3>Design considerations</h3>
<p>The development of the PROV-JSON representation has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: PROV-JSON aims to map closely the Provenance Data Model in order to ensure the interoperability between applications adopting the W3C's future recommendation. Therefore, provenance information represented in PROV-JSON can be converted from and to its counterpart in the Provenance Abstract Syntax Notation (PROV-ASN) of PROV-DM.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: native JavaScript data types are used where possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: application-specific terms and data can be introduced via the use of namespaces and custom data types.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: The design of PROV-JSON aims to follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_Configuration">Convention-over-Configuration</a> approach. Although PROV-JSON will offer flexibility in extending the core specification to accommodate application-specific requirements, it is possible to produce simple PROV-JSON structures without unnecessary overhead, such as namespace declarations.</li>
</ul>


<div class="note">This version does not include mappings for <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/ProvenanceModel.html#common-relations">common relation records</a> due to a number of changes planned to be soon implemented with respect to these relations in PROV-DM. However, the general <a href="#record-relation">PROV-JSON structure of relations</a> can be broadly followed for such relations. The next version of this document will provide specific mappings for the missing relations.</div>

<section> 
<h3>Structure of this Document</h3>

<p><a href="#data-typing">Section 2</a> describes the convention for encoding typed values in PROV-JSON.</p>

<p><a href="#prov-json-representation">Section 3</a> specifies the JSON encoding for all PROV-DM records.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="#extensibility-section">Section 4</a> summarizes PROV-JSON's extensibility points.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="#prov-json-example">Appendix A</a> provides a PROV-JSON example representation encoding <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#prov-dm-example">the PROV-DM's File Scenario</a>.</p>

</section> 

<section id="prov-dm-namespace">
<h3>Namespace</h3>

<p>All the elements, relations, reserved names and attributes used in this specification belong to the PROV-DM namespace, which is <span class="name">http://www.w3.org/ns/prov-dm/</span> (TBC).</p>
</section>


<section>
<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].</p>
</section> 

</section> 

<section id="data-typing"> 

<h2>JSON Data Typing</h2>

<p>A JSON literal value is defined as being one of an object, array, number, string, boolean, or null. To allow for extra specificity, the data type of a literal in PROV-JSON may be provided using a 2-element array. The first element in this array is the literal value and the second element is the data type, given as a QName or URI. Null is not defined here: a null value should simply be omitted from the dictionary. Array is represented with the provjs:array type, discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>The following mappings apply for the default JSON types.</p>

<dl>
<dt>number</dt>
<dd>xsd:double</dd>
<dt>string</dt>
<dd>xsd:string</dd>
<dt>boolean</dt>
<dd>xsd:boolean</dd>
<dt>array</dt>
<dd>provjs:array</dd>
</dl>

<pre class="example">
    "prefix": {
        "x": "http://example.org/",
        "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes#"
    },
    ...
    "entity": {
        "e1": {
            "x:byteSize": [1034, "xsd:positiveInteger"],
            "x:compression": [82.5, "xsd:decimal"],
            "x:content": ["Y29udGVudCBoZXJl", "xsd:base64Binary"],
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>If the data type is derived from one of the above mappings then the literal value may be kept in its original form. If the value is written as a string, it is the responsibility of the implementation to parse it correctly according to its type. The following example shows four representations of the same value: one as a JSON literal; one as a JSON literal with the type explicitly stated; one as a string literal (thus requiring parsing by the implementation); and one with a custom type which will also be delegated to the implementation.</p>

<pre class="example">
    "entity": {
        "e1": {
            "x:visible": true,
            "x:visible": [true, "xsd:boolean"],
            "x:visible": ["true", "xsd:boolean"],
            "x:visible": ["true", "ex:customBoolean"],
        }
    }
</pre>


<div class='note'>How to represent objects in PROV-JSON is being under consideration. In the next version, PROV-JSON will possibly support serializing typed objects either in an application-specific encoding or as native JSON objects with type information.</div>

<h3>Representing Arrays</h3>

<p>Some keys in PROV-JSON may have more than one value. To provide an array structure with the data typing approach above, we support the use of 'provjs:array' as a data type in the second element of a PROV-JSON literal. It is represented as a JSON array containing a combination of literals and literal/type pairs. For example:</p>

<pre class="example">
    "entity": {
        "e1": {
            "x:values": [[[1, "xsd:integer"], 2, [1034, "xsd:positiveInteger"], [82.5, "xsd:decimal"], ["Y29udGBudCBoZXJl", "xsd:base64Binary"]], "provjs:array"]
        }
    }
</pre>

<h2>Representing the Provenance Data Model in JSON</h2>

<p>This section defines the JSON serialization mappings for PROV-DM records.</p>

<section id="PROV-JSON-overview"> 
      
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>A <span class="nonterminal">recordContainer</span> (see section <a href="#RecordContainer">Record Container</a>) is used to wrap PROV-DM records and facilitate their interchange. In PROV-JSON, it is represented in one JSON structure:</p>

<div class="grammar"><pre>
{
    "entity": { <span class="code-comment">// Map of entities by entities' IDs</span>
    },
    "activity": { <span class="code-comment">// Map of activities by IDs</span>
    },
    "agent": [ <span class="code-comment">// List of IDs of entities asserted as agents</span>
    ],
    "note": { <span class="code-comment">// Map of notes by IDs</span>
    },
    &lt;<i>relationName</i>&gt;: { <span class="code-comment">// A map of relations of type <i>relationName</i> by their IDs</span>
    },
    ...
    "account": { <span class="code-comment">// Map of accounts by IDs</span>
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>In addition, the top-level container contains an additional object called <span class="name">prefix</span> that defines all namespaces referred in the document.</p>

<div class="grammar"><pre>
{
    "prefix": {
        "default": "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov-dm/",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre></div>

<p>The following sections define how each PROV-DM record is represented in PROV-JSON.</p>

</section>

<section id="record-element"> 
<h3>Element</h3>

<p>This section describes the JSON representations for all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-element">PROV-DM elements</a>: <span class="nonterminal">entityRecord</span>, <span class="nonterminal">activityRecord</span>, <span class="nonterminal">agentRecord</span>, and <span class="nonterminal">noteRecord</span>. In the container to which these elements belong, they are put in separate structures whose names are <span class="name">entity</span>, <span class="name">activity</span>, <span class="name">agent</span>, and <span class="name">note</span>, respectively.</p>


<section id="record-Entity"> 
      
<h4>Entity Record</h4>

<p>In PROV-JSON, each <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-Entity">entity</a> is represented as a property in the <span class="nonterminal">entity</span> object, identified by the entity's <span class="name">id. The</span> property's value itself is an object structure containing the entity's attribute-values pairs.</p>

The following entity assertion, for example,
<pre class="example">
entity(e0, [ prov:type="File", ex:path="/shared/crime.txt", ex:creator="Alice" ])
</pre>
is serialized into the following structure
<pre class="example">
    ...
    "entity": {
        "e0": {
            "type": "File",
            "ex:path": "/shared/crime.txt",
            "ex:creator": "Alice"
        }
    },
    ...
</pre>

<div class="note">In the example above, since <span class="name">type</span> is a term belonging to the <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a>, the use of a prefix is not required. See Section <a href="#RecordContainer">Record Container</a> for details on how to use prefixes and namespaces.</div>

</section> 

<section id="record-Activity"> 
<h3>Activity Record</h3>

<p>Each <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-Activity">Activity</a> is represented as a property in the <span class="name">activity</span> object identified by the Activity's <span class="name">id</span>. The property's value itself is an object structure containing the Activity's properties and its other attribute-values pairs.</p>

<p>
The following Activity assertion, for example,</p>
<pre class="example">
activity(a1,add-crime-in-london,2011-11-16T16:05:00,2011-11-16T16:06:00,[ex:host="server.example.org",prov:type="ex:edit"])
</pre>
<p>is serialized into:</p>
<pre class="example">
    ...
    "activity": {
        "a1": {
            "recipeLink": "add-crime-in-london",
            "startTime": ["2011-11-16T16:05:00", "xsd:dateTime"],
            "endTime": ["2011-11-16T16:06:00", "xsd:dateTime"],
            "ex:host": "server.example.org",
            "type": "ex:edit"
        }
    },
    ...
</pre>
<div class="note">Extra attribute-value pairs of an activity record are put at the same level with other properties in an activity JSON structure.</div>

<p>The values of <span class="nonterminal">startTime</span> and <span class="nonterminal">endTime</span> MUST conform to xsd:dateTime [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]].</p>
</section> 

<section id="record-Agent">
<h3>Agent Record</h3>

<p>In PROV-DM, an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-Agent">agent</a> is a representation of an entity capable of activity. Since an <span class="nonterminal">agentRecord</span> does not have any property, the <span class="name">agent</span> structure in PROV-JSON is organized as an array which contains the identifiers of all the entities that are asserted as agents (i.e. not an object structure like <span class="name">entity</span> or <span class="name">activity</span>).

<pre class="example">
agent(e1, [ex:employee="1234" %% xsd:integer, ex:name="Alice", prov:type="prov:Person" %% xsd:QName])
</pre>
is encoded into:
<pre class="example">
    ...
    "entity": {
        "e1": {
            "ex:employee": [1234, "xsd:integer"],
            "ex:name": "Alice",
            "type": ["Person", "xsd:QName"]
        }
        ...
    },
    "agent": ["e1", ...],
    ...
</pre>
<div class="note"> Can we always expect the value of a <span class="name">type</span> property to be a URI?</div>
</section>

<section id="record-note"> 
      
<h4>Note Record</h4>

<p>In PROV-DM, a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-note">note</a> is a set of name-value pairs, whose meaning is application specific. It is represented in PROV-JSON as a property of the <span class="name">note</span> object, identified by the note's <span class="name">id</span>. The property's value itself is an object structure containing the note's attribute-values pairs.</p> 

<p>
The following note record, for example,</p>
<pre class="example">
note(ann1,[ex:color="blue", ex:screenX="20" %% xsd:integer, ex:screenY="30" %% xsd:integer])
</pre>
<p>is encoded in PROV-JSON as follows.</p>
<pre class="example">
    ...
    "note": {
        "ann1": {
            "ex:color": "blue",
            "screenX": [20, "xsd:integer"],
            "screenY": [30, "xsd:integer"]
        }
    }
    ...
</pre>

</section> 

</section>


<section id="record-relation">
<h3>Relation</h3>

<p>This section specifies how various <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-relation">relation records</a> in PROV-DM are serialized in PROV-JSON.</p>

<p>In general, a <span class="nonterminal">relationRecord</span> has the following construct:</p>

<div class='grammar'>
<span class="nonterminal">relationRecord</span>&nbsp;:=  
<span class="nonterminal">relationName</span>
(<span class="nonterminal">identifier1</span>,
<span class="nonterminal">identifier2</span>,
[<span class="nonterminal">additionalProperties</span>],
[<span class="nonterminal">qualifiers</span>])
<br/>
</div>
<p>where <span class="nonterminal">identifier1</span> and <span class="nonterminal">identifier2</span> are identifiers to PROV-DM elements</p>
Relations are grouped by <span class="nonterminal">relationName</span> in a PROV-JSON structure.
<div class="grammar"><pre>
    ...
    "notes": { ... },
    <i>relationName</i>: {
        <span class="code-comment">// relationName(identifier1, identifier2, ...)</span>
        <i>relationID</i>: {
            <i>attribute1</i>: <em>identifier1</em>,
            <i>attribute2</i>: <em>identifier2</em>,
                ...
        },
        <span class="code-comment">// More relationID,identifier1,identifier2 structures here if there are more instances of relationName(...)</span>
    },
    <i>otherRelationName</i>: {
        ...

</pre></div>
Any values of <span class="nonterminal">additionalProperties</span> and <span class="nonterminal">qualifiers</span> are specified alongside the identifier pairs in above structure.

<p>Since identifiers of relations are optional in PROV-DM, there may be cases where <span class="nonterminal">relationID</span>s are missing. However, they are still required in order to maintain the validity of a PROV-JSON structure. In such cases, it is up to the serialization algorithm to generate a valid identifier for <span class="nonterminal">relationID</span> that is unique internally to a PROV-JSON serialization. For example, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/#nodeID">nodeID production in Turtle</a> may be used for this purpose, e.g. <code>_:A1</code>.</p>

<p>The following sections provide more details on how each type of relation is serialized via typical examples.</p>

<h3>Bundle</h3>

In this section, the PROV-JSON representations for the two PROV-DM's bundling constructs are introduced, i.e., <span class="nonterminal">record container</span>  and <span class="nonterminal">account record</span>.

<section id="RecordContainer">
<h4>Provenance Container</h4>

<p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#RecordContainer">provenance container</a> is a house-keeping construct of PROV-DM used for bundling PROV-DM records. A PROV-JSON serialization represents an instance of provenance container. This is the outermost level of a PROV-JSON structure. In addition to the top-level JSON structures like <span class="name">entity</span>, <span class="name">activity</span>, <span class="name">agent</span>, etc., particular namespaces used in a PROV-JSON structure can be declared in a <span class="name">prefix</span> structure (see an example below). Prefixes can then be used to bind terms to specific namespaces. There is a special prefix called <code>default</code>, which can be used to declare the default namespace to which all unprefixed terms will be bound.</p>

<p><strong>Default prefixes</strong>: By default, the following prefixes are implicitly defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>prov</code>: <span class="name">http://www.w3.org/ns/prov-dm/</span> (i.e. <a href="#prov-dm-namespace">PROV-DM namespace</a>)</li>
  <li><code>xsd</code>: <span class="name">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes</span> (i.e. XML Datatypes [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]])</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, terms that are prefixed with <code>prov:</code> or <code>xsd:</code> will be implicitly bound to the relevant namespaces without the need for their explicit declarations. In addition, the <code>default</code> prefix is implicitly defined to be <code>prov</code>. As a result, terms in the PROV-DM namespace can be written either with or without the <code>prov</code> prefix, <strong>unless</strong> a different default namespace is explicitly defined (in which case, only the former can be used).</p>

<p>
The following container </p>
<pre class="example">
container([x http://example.org/], [acc1,acc2]
          account(acc1,http://example.org/asserter1,...)
          account(acc2,http://example.org/asserter1,...))
</pre>
<p> is represented as follows in PROV-JSON.</p>
<pre class="example">
{
    "prefix": {
        "x": "http://example.org/"
    },
    ...
    "account": {
        "acc1": {
            "asserter": "http://example.org/asserter1",
            ...
        },
        "acc2": {
            "asserter": "http://example.org/asserter2",
            ...
        }
    }
}
</pre>

</section>


<section id="record-Account">
<h3>Account Record</h3>

<p>In PROV-DM, an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#record-Account">account record</a> is a wrapper of records with a dual purpose:  </p> 
<ul>
<li> It is the mechanism by which attribution of provenance can be asserted; it allows asserters to bundle up their assertions, and assert suitable attribution;
<li> It provides a scoping mechanism for record identifiers and for some constraints.</li>
</ul>


<p> An account is in PROV-DM is serialized into an object in the <span class="name">account</span> structure in a PROV-JSON representation. The following account record, for example,</p>
<pre class="example">
  account(acc0,
        http://example.org/asserter, 
          entity(e0, [ prov:type="File", ex:path="/shared/crime.txt", ex:creator="Alice" ])
          ...
          wasDerivedFrom(e2,e1)
          ...
          activity(a0,create-file,t)
          ...
          wasGeneratedBy(e0,a0,[])     
          ...
          wasAssociatedWith(a4, ag5, [prov:role="communicator"])  )
</pre>
<p>is encoded as:</p>
<pre class="example">
{
    ...
    "account": {
        "acc0": {
            "asserter": "http://example.org/asserter",
            <span class="code-comment">// The remaining records of acc0 are encoded as specified in the previous sections</span>
            "entity": { ... },
            "activity": { ... },
            "agent": [ ... ],
            "note": { ... },
            "wasAssociatedWith": { ... },
            "wasDerivedFrom": { ... },
            "wasGeneratedBy": { ... }
            
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>PROV-DM allows an account to be nested in another account. The following example shows account <span class="name">acc3</span> contains a nested account <span class="name">acc4</span>.</p>
<pre class="example">
  account(acc3,
        http://example.org/asserter1, 
          entity(e0, [ prov:type="File", ex:path="/shared/crime.txt", ex:creator="Alice" ])
          activity(a0,create-file,t)
          wasGeneratedBy(e0,a0,[])  
          account(acc4,
                 http://example.org/asserter2,
                 entity(e1, [ prov:type="File", ex:path="/shared/crime.txt", ex:creator="Alice", ex:content="" ])

<h2>Extensibility Points</h2>

<p>Since the PROV-JSON representation was developed to represent PROV-DM, it supports the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#extensibility-section">extensibility points</a> provided by PROV-DM, allowing designers to specialize it to specific applications or domains. We summarize these extensibility points here:

<ul>
<li> Applications are free to introduce application-specific attributes. They can be distinguished by qualifying them with a prefix denoting a namespace declared in a <a href="#RecordContainer">namespace declaration</a>. </li>

<li>Note records allow arbitrary metadata to be associated with identifiable records of PROV-DM. Note records consist of name-value pairs. Like attributes, names are qualified by a namespace.</li>

<li>Namespaces allow attributes and names to be qualified. </li>

<li>Subtyping is allowed by means of the reserved attribute <span class="name">type</span>.</li>

<li>Domain specific values can be expressed by means of <a href="#data-typing">typed literals</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h2>PROV-JSON Serialization Example</h2>

In order to illustrate the use of PROV-JSON in a real-world scenario, this section provides the PROV-JSON representation for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#prov-dm-example">File Scenario</a> given in the [[PROV-DM]] as an example.

<section> 
<h3>A File Scenario</h3>

<p>This scenario is concerned with the evolution of a crime statistics file (referred to as e0) stored on a shared file system and which journalists Alice, Bob, Charles, David, and Edith can share and edit. We consider various events in the evolution of file e0; events listed below follow each other, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>Event evt1: Alice creates (a0) an empty file in /share/crime.txt.  We denote this e1.</p>

<p>Event evt2: Bob appends (a1) the following line to /share/crime.txt:</p>
<pre>
There was a lot of crime in London last month.
</pre>
<p>We denote this e2.</p>

<p>Event evt3: Charles emails (a2) the contents of /share/crime.txt, as an attachment, which we refer to as e4. (We specifically refer to a copy of the file that is uploaded on the mail server.)</p>

<p>Event evt4: David edits (a3) file /share/crime.txt as follows.</p>
<pre>
There was a lot of crime in London and New-York last month.
</pre>
<p>We denote this e3.</p>

<p>Event evt5: Edith emails (a4) the contents of /share/crime.txt as an attachment, referred to as e5.</p>

<p>Event evt6: between events evt4 and evt5, someone (unspecified) runs a spell checker (a5) on the file /share/crime.txt. The file after spell checking is referred to as e6.</p>

<h3>Encoding using PROV-JSON</h3>

In this section, provenance assertions in the file scenario above (see [[PROV-DM]] for explanation of those assertions) are encoded into a PROV-JSON representation (following the mappings specified in Section <a href="#prov-json-representation">Representing the Provenance Data Model in JSON</a> above).
