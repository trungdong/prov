TODO:
1. Change base class from PROVObject to Record;
2. Change PROVGraph class to PROVContainer class, which should be a separate class to Record;
3. Account class should be a direct sub-class to Record;
4. Remove the ' %% ' separator option for dealing with literal type; (DONE)
5. Change <class>.to_JSON function to <class>.to_provJSON;
6. Add .asserter and .attributes for Account class;

Known issues:
1. No delete/remove functions available;
2. Account/Container class should have a separate class variable for default namespace;
3. Account should have own namespaces, and Account/Container.to_provJSON function will need to be able to merge all namespaces, and deal with prefix clashes;
