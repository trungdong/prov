		<h3 id="Overview">The API Overview</h3>
		<p>The PROV-JSON API provides a RESTfull web service for
		storage and access of provenance bundles in JSON format as specified 
		<a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/tdh/json/">here</a> 
		for the W3C's Provenance Data Model. Trough the API any client can manipulate bundles
		stored on a server and explore and retrieve information from other clients.
		</p>
		<div id="Authentication" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>API Key Authentication</h3>
		<p>The API supports Basic Http Authentication with user credential in the form of username and API Key.
		For this reason we suggest using the API Key Authenitcation only with secure connection(https/ssl/...).
		The user credentials are in the form of username, chosen by the client at registration, 
		and an auto generated API key*. Those two credential are yours to protect from any 
		possible abuse. When you log in to the webUI developed for managing the client's accounts
		you can view your API key by going from the top navigation bar to 'API Key'. For security
		reasons we have provided a way of generating new API key on request of the client, in case
		the API key has been compromised. You can and delete your API key which will lead to 
		"locking out" your account out of the API.
		 </br></br>
		* Note that the user credential here mentioned (username and API key) are not the same as 
		the credential used for the webUI. The username is the same, but on registration the client
		creates his own separate password for accessing the webUI, which is different from the API key.
		You can assume that the webUI is like admin panel for managing your account and the API is the 
		actual RESTfull service on the server. 
		</p>
		<div id="Usage" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
		<p>The API supports all of the RESTfull methods PUT/POST/GET/DELETE.
		Whenever trough your application you should query the server at the api
		url, which normally will be in the form https://'domain'/'API url'/'resource name',
		where 'domain' is the domain address of the server(www.example.com),
		the API url is in the form 'api/vX' where X is version used(api/v0),
		the resource name is the Bundles name chosen by the service provider(account).
		The example url would form into 'https://www.example.com/api/v0/account'.
		This query would be to the list of all your bundles (by 'yours' is meant to which
		you have the appropriate permission dependable on the method type of the request).
		If you want to access a specific resource you should first acquire it's ID(12) and the 
		append it at the end of the url with a slash(/) in front:</br>
		https://www.example.com/api/v0/12</br>
		Every request should be correctly authenticated in order to receive the desired response.
		The Authentication is done as specified by the Basic Authentication portocol - setting 
		the 'Authorization' Header of the request with the correct credential. The format used is 
		'ApiKey username:key'. Note the first 'ApiKey' stands for the literal 'ApiKey' and it
		defines the type of authentication you are using. The user credentials are not hashed at all, 
		rather send in plain form.<br/>
		The only other requirement is that the data you send to the server to be in correct JSON
		form as specified by the RPOV-JSON documentation. 
		</p>
		<div id="Example" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<p>For this example let's assume you are a client with username 'patence' 
		and an API key 'b4702794b52445bab04a51ead73d5adbc554c970'. </br>
		The variable 'bundle' is assumed trough the examples to be any abstract object
		representation of a provenance bundle. Different languages and implementation 
		are possible, the only requirement is that it can be serialized accordingly.</br></br>
		If you want to add a new bundle to your account you should use the 'POST' method on the 
		resource list url. If the POST is successful the response will contain the new 
		bundle's information, including it's ID, and its location in a header.</p>
		<pre>
var user = 'patence';
var pass = 'b4702794b52445bab04a51ead73d5adbc554c970';
var tok = user + ':' + pass;
var auth = 'ApiKey ' + tok;</pre>
<div id="js" class="anchorOffset"></div>
<h3>JavaScript</h3> </p>
		<pre>
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.setRequestHeader('Content Type', 'applicaton/json');
request.setRequestHeader('Authorization', auth);
// Create the callback:
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
	if (request.readyState != 4) return; // Not there yet
	if (request.status != 200) {
	// Handle request failure here...
	return;
	}
request.open('POST','https://www.example.com/api/v0/account');
request.send();
// Request successful, read the response
var response = request.responseText;
// ... and use it as needed by your application</pre>
		<div id="ajax" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Ajax</h3>
		<pre>
$.ajax({
	type: 'POST',
	url: 'https://www.example.com/api/v0/account/',
	data: JSON.stringify(bundle),
	contentType: 'application/json',
	beforeSend: function(req) {
		req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', auth);
	},
	success: function(data) {
		//do something with the data received
	}
});</pre>
		<div id="php" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>PHP</h3>
		<pre>
// Create Http context details
$contextData = array ( 
	'method' => 'POST',
	'header' => 
		"Connection: close\r\n".
		"Content-Length: ".strlen($bundle_serialized)."\r\n".
		"Content-Type: application/json\r\n".
		"Authorization: ".$auth."\r\n",
	'content'=> $bundle_serialized);
// Create context resource for our request
$context = stream_context_create (array ( 'http' => $contextData ));
// Read page rendered as result of your POST request
$result =  file_get_contents (
                  'https://www.example.com/api/v0/account/',false, $context);
// Server response is now stored in $result variable so you can process it
});</pre>
