# Conformance audit findings — Phase 3.5 (roadmap steps 28–32)

**Status:** In progress. Working document; each audit task appends its section.
**Triage:** Section 6 is filled by the triage task (step 31) after maintainer sign-off.

## 0. Baseline (recorded before any audit work)

- Test suite tally: `932 passed, 16 skipped, 6 xfailed, 95 warnings in 8.09s` (`uv run pytest`,
  2026-07-10, branch `audit/conformance-matrix` at the tip of `master`
  (c195be7)). The 95 warnings are pytest's own capture-warnings summary of `UserWarning`s
  intentionally raised by `provrdf.py:692` inside three existing tests
  (`test_json_to_ttl_match`, `test_membership_{1,2,3}[rdf]`, plus the parametrized statement
  tests) — pre-existing, unrelated to this task, not touched.
- ruff: `uv run ruff check src/` → `All checks passed!`
- mypy: `uv run mypy src` → `Success: no issues found in 17 source files`
- sphinx: `uv run --group docs --extra rdf --extra xml sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html`
  → `build succeeded.` (0 warnings)

## 1. Conformance matrix findings (step 28)

Findings surfaced while building `docs/reference/conformance.md`, verified against source:

- **No dedicated factories for the PROV-DM agent subtypes** (`Person`, `Organization`,
  `SoftwareAgent`, PROV-DM §5.3.1). `ProvBundle.agent()` (`src/prov/model/bundle.py:812`)
  creates a plain `prov:Agent`; the subtype must be added by hand via
  `other_attributes={PROV_TYPE: "prov:Person"}` (or equivalent). This is already documented as
  intentional in `docs/explanation/prov-dm.md:111-114`, and `ADDITIONAL_N_MAP`
  (`src/prov/constants.py:75-84`) does carry PROV-N keywords for all three
  (`person`/`organization`/`softwareAgent`) plus `plan`, so the vocabulary constants exist —
  only the convenience factories are missing. Feature gap, not a defect; candidate for 3.0
  triage (new small factories, or leave as documented `prov:type` idiom).
- **No dedicated factory for `EmptyCollection`** (PROV-DM §5.6). `PROV["EmptyCollection"]` is a
  real constant with a PROV-N keyword (`ADDITIONAL_N_MAP`, `src/prov/constants.py:83`) and a
  `PROV_BASE_CLS` entry mapping it to `PROV_ENTITY` (`src/prov/constants.py:120`), so the
  round-trip machinery understands the type — but `ProvBundle.collection()`
  (`src/prov/model/bundle.py:1221`) has no `empty=` flag or sibling `empty_collection()` method.
  Same shape as the agent-subtype gap above: vocabulary present, convenience factory absent.
  Feature gap, candidate for 3.0 triage.
- **`prov:Bundle` as a first-class entity type (PROV-DM §5.4.2) is not implemented at all** —
  not even as a documented `prov:type` idiom. `PROV_BUNDLE` (`src/prov/constants.py:42`) exists
  as a QualifiedName constant with a PROV-N keyword mapping (`"bundle"`,
  `src/prov/constants.py:69`) and a `PROV_BASE_CLS` entry, but grepping the full source tree
  shows it is consumed only by `src/prov/dot.py` (node styling for the `folder` shape) and is
  never referenced by any serializer (`provjson.py`, `provxml.py`, `provrdf.py`, `provn.py`) or
  by any `ProvBundle`/`ProvDocument` method. `ProvBundle.get_provn()`
  (`src/prov/model/bundle.py:315-350`) emits the PROV-N `bundle <id> ... endBundle` block
  structurally (via `is_document()`/`is_bundle()` branching), not through a `prov:Bundle`-typed
  record and not through the `PROV_N_MAP["bundle"]` keyword — that keyword is present in the
  lookup table but is dead code as far as the current model/serializer implementation goes. In
  other words: `prov` implements bundle *containment* (§5.4.1, `ProvDocument.bundle()` /
  `add_bundle()`) but not the PROV-DM notion of a bundle's identifier also denoting an entity of
  type `prov:Bundle` for provenance-of-provenance assertions (§5.4.2) — a user cannot currently
  attribute a bundle to an agent or otherwise make first-class PROV statements about the bundle
  itself as an entity, because there is no supported path from `ProvBundle.identifier` to a
  `ProvEntity` typed `prov:Bundle` in the same document. Feature gap (and worth flagging the
  unused `PROV_N_MAP` entry as very minor dead-weight); candidate for 3.0 triage.
- **Issue #154 re-read**: title is "Add convenient assertion methods for revision, quotation,
  primary source, mention & influence records". The bundle-level factories it mentions in
  passing (`revision()`, `quotation()`, `primary_source()`, `mention()`, `influence()`) **all
  already exist** on `ProvBundle` (`src/prov/model/bundle.py:1011,1056,1101,1194,935`) with
  camelCase aliases (`wasRevisionOf`/`wasQuotedFrom`/`hadPrimarySource`/`mentionOf`/
  `wasInfluencedBy`, `bundle.py:1358-1364`) — but that was never what the issue was asking for.
  Its actual ask is **record-level (`ProvElement`) chaining methods**, the pattern demonstrated
  by the issue's own example, `e1.wasDerivedFrom(e2)`. Checked `records.py` directly:
  `ProvEntity` (`records.py:763-900`) already has `wasGeneratedBy`, `wasInvalidatedBy`,
  `wasDerivedFrom`, `wasAttributedTo`, `alternateOf`, `specializationOf`, `hadMember` as
  self-as-first-argument convenience methods that delegate to `self._bundle.<factory>(self,
  ...)` and return `self` for chaining — but genuinely lacks `wasRevisionOf`, `wasQuotedFrom`,
  `hadPrimarySource`, and `mentionOf`. Likewise `ProvActivity` (`records.py:900-1057`) has
  `used`, `wasInformedBy`, `wasStartedBy`, `wasEndedBy`, `wasAssociatedWith` but lacks
  `wasInfluencedBy`, and `ProvAgent` (`records.py:1131-1163`) has only `actedOnBehalfOf` and
  also lacks `wasInfluencedBy`. So issue #154's five requested methods are **all still
  missing**, exactly as filed: `ProvEntity.wasRevisionOf`, `ProvEntity.wasQuotedFrom`,
  `ProvEntity.hadPrimarySource`, `ProvEntity.mentionOf`, and `wasInfluencedBy` on all three of
  `ProvEntity`/`ProvActivity`/`ProvAgent`. Still open, valid, and narrowly scoped; recommend
  keeping it open and triaging in step 31 as a 2.x-safe additive feature (same shape as the
  agent-subtype/EmptyCollection gaps above — purely additive, no output/behaviour change to
  existing methods).
- **PROV-N metacharacter escaping (#223) applies generically**, not to one row: any concept
  whose identifier's local part contains a PROV-N metacharacter (`'`, `)`, `,`, `(`, `:`, `;`,
  `[`, `]`, `=`) produces invalid PROV-N text regardless of record type, because the bug is in
  `QualifiedName.provn_representation()` (`src/prov/identifier.py`), shared by every record. The
  matrix notes this once under the PROV-N column header rather than repeating it per row.
- **Round-trip skip/xfail counts reconciled exactly against the baseline** (`uv run pytest -q
  -rs -rx`): the `16 skipped` = 14 rdf-target "scruffy" skips in `test_statements.py` (2 each of
  generation/invalidation/usage, 4 each of start/end — `RDF_SCRUFFY_SKIP`, #217) + 2 unrelated
  `test_minimal_install.py` skips that are an artefact of running with both extras installed
  (`test_rdf_unavailable_raises_informative_error` / `test_xml_unavailable_raises_informative_error`
  skip themselves when `rdflib`/`lxml` *are* present — expected, not a conformance finding). The
  `6 xfailed` = 3 in `test_attributes.py` (`test_entity_with_one_type_attribute_decimal` for
  #77, `test_entity_with_multiple_attribute` and `test_entity_with_multiple_value_attribute` for
  #218) + 3 regression-guard xfails in `test_rdf.py`/`test_xml.py`
  (`test_float_precision_survives_rdf_roundtrip` #225,
  `test_qualified_delegation_pair_survives_rdf_roundtrip` #226,
  `test_empty_string_attribute_survives_xml_roundtrip` #224) — i.e. every one of #77/#217/#218/
  #224/#225/#226 has a live characterization test in the suite already; #223 (PROV-N escaping)
  has no dedicated xfail because PROV-N has no parser to round-trip through.
- **`prov:Bundle` PROV-N keyword row aside**: since `PROV_N_MAP["bundle"]` is unused by the
  actual `get_provn()` implementation (see above), the conformance matrix's PROV-N column for
  the "Bundle constructor" row describes the real, hand-written `bundle <id> ... endBundle`
  output rather than citing a keyword lookup.

## 2. Formal attributes & PROV-DM §5 semantics (step 29)

Audited 2026-07-10 on branch `audit/prov-dm-section5` against
[PROV-DM (W3C REC 2013-04-30)](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/) §5. Method: the spec's
per-concept attribute lists were extracted verbatim as the baseline (condensed in §2.0
below), then compared against `FORMAL_ATTRIBUTES` in `src/prov/model/records.py`, the
`ProvBundle` factory signatures in `src/prov/model/bundle.py`, and the datatype machinery
(`parse_xsd_types` / `Literal` / `_auto_literal_conversion` in `records.py`). Every
non-conformance claim below was confirmed by an executed reproduction (snippets inline).
Known issues #34/#77/#89/#96/#154/#168/#217/#218/#223–#228 are used as anchors and not
re-reported.

### 2.0 Baseline: `FORMAL_ATTRIBUTES` vs the spec's attribute lists

Spec signature (id omitted; `*` = spec-optional) vs the class tuple:

| Record type | PROV-DM signature | `FORMAL_ATTRIBUTES` (`records.py`) | Order/content match |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entity §5.1.1 | id only | `()` | yes |
| Activity §5.1.2 | st\*, et\* | `(startTime, endTime)` | yes |
| Generation §5.1.3 | e, a\*, t\* | `(entity, activity, time)` | yes |
| Usage §5.1.4 | a, e\*, t\* | `(activity, entity, time)` | yes |
| Communication §5.1.5 | informed, informant | `(informed, informant)` | yes |
| Start §5.1.6 | a, trigger\*, starter\*, t\* | `(activity, trigger, starter, time)` | yes |
| End §5.1.7 | a, trigger\*, ender\*, t\* | `(activity, trigger, ender, time)` | yes |
| Invalidation §5.1.8 | e, a\*, t\* | `(entity, activity, time)` | yes |
| Derivation §5.2.1 | e2, e1, a\*, g2\*, u1\* | `(generatedEntity, usedEntity, activity, generation, usage)` | yes |
| Agent §5.3.1 | id only | `()` | yes |
| Attribution §5.3.2 | e, ag | `(entity, agent)` | yes |
| Association §5.3.3 | a, ag\*, pl\* | `(activity, agent, plan)` | yes |
| Delegation §5.3.4 | ag2, ag1, a\* | `(delegate, responsible, activity)` | yes |
| Influence §5.3.5 | o2, o1 | `(influencee, influencer)` | yes |
| Specialization §5.5.1 | infra, supra (no id/attrs) | `(specificEntity, generalEntity)` | yes |
| Alternate §5.5.2 | e1, e2 (no id/attrs) | `(alternate1, alternate2)` | yes |
| Membership §5.6.2 | c, e (no id/attrs) | `(collection, entity)` | yes |
| Mention (PROV-Links) | infra, supra, b | `(specificEntity, generalEntity, bundle)` | yes (see §2.5) |

All 18 tuples match the spec's attribute list and order exactly. The
QName-vs-literal partition is also correct: `PROV_ATTRIBUTE_LITERALS`
(`constants.py:182`) contains exactly the three `xsd:dateTime`-typed formals
(`time`, `startTime`, `endTime`); every other formal is in `PROV_ATTRIBUTE_QNAMES`,
matching the spec (all non-time formals are identifiers).

### 2.1 §5.1 Entities and Activities

- **Entity**: mandatory id enforced (`ProvElementIdentifierRequired`, `records.py:735-737`);
  attributes optional. Conformant.
- **Activity**: `activity(identifier, startTime=None, endTime=None, ...)` — both times
  optional, order (st, et) matches. Times are validated as `datetime` (strings parsed);
  a non-datetime raises `ProvException` on the `add_attributes` path. Two time-handling
  findings, both in the shared `_ensure_datetime` helper (`records.py:103-112`) used by
  *every* factory `time=`/`startTime=`/`endTime=` parameter — see §2.7.3 (filed as #237).
- **Generation / Usage / Invalidation**: formal attributes, order, and optionality of the
  factory signatures (`generation(entity, activity=None, time=None, ...)` etc.,
  `bundle.py:588,625,744`) all match. The spec's "at least one of id, activity, time,
  attributes MUST be present" rule is not enforced — `d.generation("ex:e1")` produces
  `wasGeneratedBy(ex:e1, -, -)` silently (executed; see §2.8 validation-gap family).
- **Communication**: both formals required by the factory, matching the spec. Conformant.
- **Start / End**: 4-tuple incl. starter/ender matches; factory optionality
  (`start(activity, trigger=None, starter=None, time=None, ...)`) matches the spec's
  markers (only `activity` mandatory). "At least one MUST be present" unenforced (§2.8).

**Verdict:** Entity, Activity, Generation, Usage, Communication, Start, End,
Invalidation — **conformant** on attributes/order/optionality; findings limited to the
cross-cutting items in §2.7.3 (time datatype handling, #237) and §2.8 (unenforced
"at-least-one" rules, needs maintainer confirmation).

### 2.2 §5.2 Derivations

- **Derivation**: 5-tuple and factory optionality match (`derivation(generatedEntity,
  usedEntity, activity=None, generation=None, usage=None, ...)`, `bundle.py:968`). The
  library permits `generation`/`usage` without `activity`
  (`d.derivation("ex:e2", "ex:e1", None, "ex:g2", "ex:u1")` →
  `wasDerivedFrom(ex:e2, ex:e1, -, ex:g2, ex:u1)`, executed) — PROV-DM §5.2.1 marks each
  individually optional (the grammar allows `-` per slot), so this is grammatically fine;
  the combination rule ("for a generation/usage to be given, the activity must be") lives
  in PROV-CONSTRAINTS 51, which is out of scope (#62 backlog). Recorded in §2.8, no issue.
- **Revision / Quotation / PrimarySource** (§5.2.2–5.2.4): defined by the spec as
  `prov:type`-subtyped derivations with no extra attributes; implemented exactly that way
  (`revision()`/`quotation()`/`primary_source()` add `PROV["Revision"]` etc. via
  `add_asserted_type`, `bundle.py:1044-1146`). The typed-`wasDerivedFrom` PROV-N rendering
  is already recorded in section 1; not repeated.

**Verdict:** Derivation (incl. Revision/Quotation/PrimarySource) — **conformant**;
PROV-CONSTRAINTS-level combination rule intentionally unenforced (§2.8 note).

### 2.3 §5.3 Agents, Responsibility, and Influence

- **Agent**: mandatory id enforced; attributes accepted. Conformant. (Missing
  Person/Organization/SoftwareAgent factories already recorded in section 1.)
- **Attribution**: `(entity, agent)` both mandatory in factory — matches spec. Conformant.
- **Association**: `association(activity, agent=None, plan=None, ...)` — spec marks agent
  and plan optional; matches. Conformant.
- **Delegation**: `delegation(delegate, responsible, activity=None, ...)` — matches spec
  (ag2, ag1, a\*). Conformant.
- **Influence**: `(influencee, influencer)` both mandatory; matches. The spec's
  influencee/influencer correspondence table (§5.3.5) is informational for queries and
  needs no model support.
- **NEW finding (filed #236)** — §5.3.1 says the agent subtype "is expressed using the
  prov:type attribute" whose pre-defined values (§5.7.2.4 table) are *qualified names*
  (`prov:Person` etc.). The library's documented idiom — `agent("ag", {prov.PROV_TYPE:
  "prov:Person"})` in `docs/explanation/prov-dm.md:114`, `docs/tutorial/getting-started.md:52`,
  `docs/reference/conformance.md:97` — passes a plain *string*, which the model stores
  unchanged (strings are never coerced to QualifiedNames, correctly so). The resulting
  record asserts the string `"prov:Person"`, not the type `prov:Person`. Executed:
  ```
  d.agent("ex:derek", {"prov:type": "prov:Person"})   # documented idiom
  # PROV-N: agent(ex:derek, [prov:type="prov:Person"])   <- string, not 'prov:Person'
  # RDF:    ex:derek a prov:Agent, "prov:Person"^^xsd:string .   <- literal as a class!
  d.agent("ex:derek", {"prov:type": PROV["Person"]})  # correct form
  # PROV-N: agent(ex:derek, [prov:type='prov:Person'])
  # RDF:    ex:derek a prov:Agent, prov:Person .
  # the two documents compare UNEQUAL
  ```
  The same string idiom appears in the library's own canonical examples
  (`src/prov/tests/examples.py:266`, `{"prov:type": "prov:Plan"}`). The model behaviour is
  conformant (a string is a legal `prov:type` value per §5.7.2.4); the defect is that the
  documentation and examples teach the string form as *the* way to denote the pre-defined
  subtypes, silently producing records that do not carry the subtype. Docs/examples fix,
  2.x-safe.

**Verdict:** Agent, Attribution, Association, Delegation, Influence — **conformant** at the
model level; **finding listed** (documentation idiom, #236).

### 2.4 §5.4 Bundles

Bundle containment (§5.4.1) is implemented structurally (`ProvDocument.bundle()` /
`add_bundle()`; named bundles only at document level, nesting refused at runtime), matching
the constructor definition. The §5.4.2 `prov:Bundle` entity-type gap (no supported path from
a bundle identifier to a `prov:Bundle`-typed entity for provenance-of-provenance) is already
recorded in full in section 1 and is not repeated here.

**Verdict:** Bundle constructor — **conformant**; Bundle type (§5.4.2) — **finding already
recorded in section 1** (feature gap, 3.0 triage).

### 2.5 §5.5 Alternate Entities

- **Specialization / Alternate**: 2-tuples match; the public factories
  (`specialization()`, `alternate()`, `bundle.py:1148,1172`) correctly accept *neither an
  identifier nor attributes*, matching the spec's explicit "is not ... an influence, and
  therefore does not have an id and attributes". The low-level escape hatch does not
  enforce this: `d.new_record(PROV_SPECIALIZATION, "ex:spec1", {...}, {"ex:note": "extra"})`
  produces `specializationOf(ex:spec1; ex:e2, ex:e1, [ex:note="extra"])` (executed) — text
  that is not derivable from the PROV-N grammar. Requires deliberate misuse of the
  low-level API (or non-conformant serialized input); recorded in §2.8, no issue.
- **Mention**: `ProvMention` (`mentionOf(infra, supra, b)`, 3-tuple, no id/attrs) is **not
  part of PROV-DM §5** — it was dropped from the REC (marked at-risk) and lives in the
  W3C PROV-Links Note. Implementing it is a conformant *extension*; the tuple matches
  PROV-Links' definition (specific, general, bundle, all mandatory in the factory).
  Documentation could label it as PROV-Links rather than PROV-DM; cosmetic, no issue.

**Verdict:** Specialization, Alternate — **conformant** (public API); Mention —
**conformant extension** (PROV-Links, not §5). Low-level `new_record` permissiveness noted
in §2.8.

### 2.6 §5.6 Collections

- **Collection**: `collection()` creates an entity typed `prov:Collection` — matches
  §5.6.1's type-based definition. (`EmptyCollection` factory gap already in section 1.)
- **Membership**: `hadMember(c, e)` — both formals mandatory in `membership()`, no
  id/attrs on the public factory; matches §5.6.2 including its "not an influence" clause
  (same `new_record` caveat as §2.5, see §2.8).

**Verdict:** Collection, Membership — **conformant**.

### 2.7 §5.7 Further elements (values, qualified names, namespace declarations)

#### 2.7.1 Identifier (§5.7.1)

Elements: mandatory id, enforced. Relations: optional id, supported. The spec's equality
rule ("two generations are equal if they have the same identifier") is *stricter* in the
library: `ProvRecord.__eq__` (`records.py:650-658`) also requires equal attribute sets, so
two same-id records with different extra attributes compare unequal (executed). This is the
unification/merging domain — deferred to step 30b (`2026-07-10-unification-gap-analysis.md`),
not re-audited here.

#### 2.7.2 Reserved attributes (§5.7.2)

- `prov:label` "MUST be a string" (§5.7.2.1): not validated — `{PROV_LABEL: 42}` is
  accepted and rendered `prov:label=42` (executed). §2.8 family.
- Multiple `prov:label`s incl. language-tagged (spec example 47): supported;
  `[prov:label="Voiture 01"@fr, prov:label="Car 01"@en]` round-trips through JSON
  (executed). Conformant.
- `prov:location`/`prov:role` "allowed in" lists: the model deliberately does not restrict
  which record types carry which reserved attributes (permissive; consistent with not
  validating). No finding beyond the §2.8 family note.
- `prov:type` (§5.7.2.4): multiple values supported (set-valued); pre-defined type
  constants all exist. String-vs-QualifiedName value distinction is honoured (a string
  stays a string) — the *documentation* defect around this is #236 (§2.3).
- `prov:value` "MAY occur at most once" (§5.7.2.5): not enforced —
  `e = d.entity("ex:e1", {PROV_VALUE: 1}); e.add_attributes({PROV_VALUE: 2})` yields
  `entity(ex:e1, [prov:value=1, prov:value=2])` (executed). The cardinality guard in
  `add_attributes` (`records.py:622-626`) covers only formal attributes
  (`PROV_ATTRIBUTES`), which `prov:value` is not. §2.8 family.

#### 2.7.3 Value / datatypes (§5.7.3)

Anchors: #89 (typed vs untyped literal indistinguishable), #77 (`xsd:decimal` Literal
comparison), #218/#225 (RDF fidelity), #168 (QName typing in PROV-JSON). New siblings found:

- **`xsd:long` literals silently re-typed as `xsd:int` (filed #235).**
  `XSD_DATATYPE_PARSERS` (`records.py:160-168`) maps both `XSD_LONG` and `XSD_INT` to
  Python `int`, so `_auto_literal_conversion` collapses an asserted `xsd:long` literal to a
  bare `int` at `add_attributes` time; every serializer then emits its reverse-map default
  `xsd:int` (`provjson.py:69-74`, `provrdf.py:90ff`). Executed:
  ```
  e = d.entity("ex:e1", {"ex:attr": Literal("42", XSD_LONG)})
  e.extra_attributes  ->  ((ex:attr, 42),)          # datatype gone at assertion time
  JSON: {"ex:attr": {"$": 42, "type": "xsd:int"}}
  RDF:  ex:attr "42"^^xsd:int .    XML: <ex:attr xsi:type="xsd:int">42</ex:attr>
  ```
  The asserted datatype is mutated in all serializations. Note the inconsistency inside
  the XSD integer family: `xsd:integer`, `xsd:short`, `xsd:byte`, `xsd:decimal`,
  unsigned/negative variants have *no* parser, remain opaque `Literal`s, and therefore
  round-trip faithfully (executed for `xsd:integer`/`xsd:decimal`) — only the two parsed
  types (`xsd:long`, `xsd:int`) lose their identity. Root-cause sibling of #89.
- **`prov:QUALIFIED_NAME`-typed literals are not resolved to QualifiedNames, breaking
  round-trip equality (filed #238).** §5.7.3 defines `"ex:value" %% prov:QUALIFIED_NAME`
  and `'ex:value'` as the *same* value. The model stores
  `Literal("ex:v", PROV_QUALIFIEDNAME)` opaquely (no parser), so it compares unequal to
  `QualifiedName(ex, "v")`; the PROV-JSON *decoder* however resolves the type on input, so
  the value mutates across a round trip and `deserialize(serialize(d)) != d`. Executed:
  ```
  d:  entity(ex:e1, [ex:a="ex:v" %% prov:QUALIFIED_NAME])
  JSON: {"ex:a": {"$": "ex:v", "type": "prov:QUALIFIED_NAME"}}
  back: entity(ex:e1, [ex:a='ex:v'])     # now a QualifiedName; back != d
  ```
  Sibling of #89 (same abstract value, two unequal representations); intersects #168.
  By contrast `xsd:QName`-typed literals stay opaque in both directions and round-trip
  stably (executed) — the #168 debate about which type PROV-JSON *should* emit is
  unchanged.
- **`xsd:anyURI`**: parsed to `Identifier` and round-trips through JSON intact (executed).
  Conformant.
- **`xsd:boolean`**: `parse_boolean` accepts exactly the XSD lexical space
  (`true/false/1/0`) and rejects others (stays a `Literal`). Conformant.
- **Time instants (`xsd:dateTime`) — filed #237.** Two defects in the factory time path
  (`_ensure_datetime`, `records.py:103-112`, used by every `time=`/`startTime=`/`endTime=`
  parameter):
  1. Unparseable strings leak a raw `dateutil.parser.ParserError` instead of the
     `ProvException` the equivalent `add_attributes` path raises (executed:
     `d.activity("ex:a1", startTime="not a date")` → `ParserError`; setting
     `PROV_ATTR_STARTTIME` via `add_attributes` → `ProvException`). Same shape as #228's
     raw-exception leak, in the model API.
  2. The valid xsd:dateTime hour-24 lexical form is rejected via that same raw error:
     `startTime="2011-11-16T24:00:00"` → `ParserError: hour must be in 0..23` (executed),
     though XSD Datatypes permits `24:00:00` (midnight end-of-day).
  Timezone handling is otherwise sound: offsets and `Z` parse to aware datetimes, an
  aware `prov:time` round-trips through JSON preserving the offset (executed), and naive
  vs aware values are simply distinct values (matching XSD's partial ordering).
  dateutil's *leniency* (accepting non-XSD forms like `"Nov 7, 2011"`) is documented API
  behaviour ("a string parseable by dateutil.parser.parse") — noted, not a defect.
- **Language-tagged strings**: `Literal(v, langtag=...)` forces
  `prov:InternationalizedString` (matching the PROV-JSON/XML rules), JSON round-trip
  preserves tag and value; RDF round-trip preserves the tag verbatim (`"hello"@EN` stays
  `@EN`, executed). One value-space nit: RDF 1.1 defines language tags as
  case-insensitive (lowercase-normalised in the value space), while `Literal.__eq__`
  compares tags case-sensitively — `Literal("hello", langtag="EN") !=
  Literal("hello", langtag="en")` (executed). Distinct-representation sibling of the #89
  family; cosmetic in practice because the library never normalises tags anywhere, so
  values survive round trips unchanged. Recorded here; **needs maintainer confirmation**
  whether 3.0 should normalise (no issue filed).

#### 2.7.4 Namespace declarations (§5.7.4)

Prefixed declarations, the default namespace (`set_default_namespace`; unprefixed name
resolved against it and round-trips through JSON, executed), and the PROV namespace IRI
(`http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#`, `constants.py:19`) are all conformant.

#### 2.7.5 Qualified names (§5.7.5)

IRI mapping is the required concatenation (`Namespace("ex", "http://example.org/")["foo"]
.uri == "http://example.org/foo"`, executed). Prefix optionality is handled via the default
namespace. Output-side escaping of metacharacters in local parts is #223 (already filed,
applies generically — see section 1); input-side the library accepts arbitrary local parts,
which is the permissive half of the same coin and needs no separate issue.

**Verdict §5.7:** Identifier, namespace declarations, qualified names — **conformant**
(modulo #223, already filed). Attributes — **findings listed** (#236 docs idiom; §2.8
validation family for label/value cardinality). Values/datatypes — **findings listed**
(#235 xsd:long mutation, #237 dateTime handling, #238 prov:QUALIFIED_NAME resolution;
langtag case-sensitivity needs maintainer confirmation).

### 2.8 Cross-cutting: unenforced PROV-DM structural constraints (needs maintainer confirmation)

The model is deliberately permissive — it asserts what it is given and defers validity to
PROV-CONSTRAINTS tooling (#62, backlog). The §5 audit collected every point where that
permissiveness lets *normative PROV-DM (not PROV-CONSTRAINTS)* rules be violated silently,
so the 3.0 triage can decide once, coherently, whether any should warn/raise:

1. Mandatory formal attributes can be omitted: `None` values are skipped by
   `add_attributes` (`records.py:574-576`), so `d.generation(None)` →
   `wasGeneratedBy(-, -, -)` and `d.communication(None, None)` → `wasInformedBy(-, -)`
   (executed) — output not derivable from the PROV-N grammar (which requires the entity /
   both activity identifiers). Reachable only by violating the factory type hints or from
   non-conformant serialized input.
2. "At least one of id/…/attributes MUST be present" (Generation §5.1.3, Usage §5.1.4,
   Start §5.1.6, End §5.1.7, Invalidation §5.1.8, Association §5.3.3): unenforced
   (`d.generation("ex:e1")` → `wasGeneratedBy(ex:e1, -, -)`, executed — grammatically
   valid, normatively incomplete).
3. `prov:value` cardinality (§5.7.2.5) and `prov:label` string-ness (§5.7.2.1): unenforced
   (§2.7.2, executed).
4. Id/attributes accepted on Specialization/Alternate/Membership via low-level
   `new_record` (§2.5, executed) — the public factories are correct.
5. Derivation generation/usage without activity: allowed (PROV-CONSTRAINTS 51 territory,
   §2.2).

Items 1–4 are normative-DM deviations; item 5 is CONSTRAINTS-only. **No issues filed** —
enforcement anywhere here is a behaviour change (2.x-frozen) and whether 3.0 wants
validation, warnings, or the status quo is an API-philosophy decision for the maintainer
(step 31 triage). Characterization tests pinning the current behaviour of items 1–3 are in
`src/prov/tests/test_conformance_dm.py`; items 4–5 are documented here only (they require
deliberate misuse of the low-level `new_record` API or CONSTRAINTS-level analysis, so
issue-body repros and scope notes suffice).

**Triage pointer:** Additional "needs maintainer confirmation" items appear in §2.7.3
(language-tag case-sensitivity for RDF round-trips).

### 2.9 Bugs found en route (not §5 conformance, filed separately)

- **`prov.read()` cannot auto-detect valid PROV-XML (filed #239)** — the Phase-3 loose
  end, confirmed: format detection tries `json → rdf → provn → xml`
  (`src/prov/__init__.py:62-68` catches only
  `TypeError/ValueError/AttributeError/KeyError`), and the RDF deserializer raises
  `rdflib...BadSyntax` — a `SyntaxError` subclass — on PROV-XML input, which propagates
  before the XML deserializer is ever tried (executed: `prov.read(path_to_valid_xml)` →
  `BadSyntax`). Two adjacent modes recorded in the issue: an *empty* source yields a
  silent empty document (rdflib parses empty trig successfully), and a raw content
  *string* — which `read()`'s docstring advertises — raises `FileNotFoundError` because a
  `str` source is always treated as a path (`bundle.py:1686-1691`).
- **`ProvDocument.serialize()` writes to a repr-named junk file (filed #240)** — the
  stream test is `isinstance(destination, IOBase)` (`bundle.py:1626`), which is false for
  common file-likes such as `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` (a `_TemporaryFileWrapper`
  proxy); such destinations fall into the file-path branch and the serialization lands in
  a file literally named e.g. `<tempfile._TemporaryFileWrapper object at 0x1052cc170>` in
  the CWD, while the intended file stays empty (executed and observed). On Python 3.14+
  the manifestation changes: `NamedTemporaryFile.__repr__` now embeds the full file path
  (including `/` characters), so the repr-derived `open()` raises `FileNotFoundError`
  instead of silently writing the junk file — same defect, different symptom.

### 2.10 Verification (step 29)

`src/prov/tests/test_conformance_dm.py` adds 6 strict xfails (one per filed defect that is
reproducible in a few lines: #235, #237 ×2, #238, #239, #240) and 4 characterization tests
pinning the §2.8 permissive behaviour. Tally moves from the section-0 baseline
`932 passed, 16 skipped, 6 xfailed` to `936 passed, 16 skipped, 12 xfailed`
(`uv run pytest`, 2026-07-10); ruff check/format, mypy (strict), and the Sphinx docs build
all remain clean.

## 3. Serializer mappings (step 30)
### 3.1 PROV-XML vs XSD

**Method:** vendored the W3C PROV-XML schema closure offline
(`src/prov/tests/schemas/prov.xsd` + `prov-core.xsd` + `prov-dictionary.xsd` +
`prov-links.xsd` + `xml.xsd`; provenance and licence note in
`src/prov/tests/schemas/README.md`) and added
`src/prov/tests/test_xml_schema.py`, which compiles the schema with
`lxml.etree.XMLSchema` and validates the serialized XML of all 8
`examples.tests` documents plus one document per entry of the
`ATTRIBUTE_VALUES` corpus (28 entries, each asserted as a `prov:type` value —
mirroring `test_attributes.py`'s convention) — 36 validation params total.

**Result:** 32 pass; 4 do not. All 4 were triaged individually; none share a
root cause:

1. **`W3C Publication 1` — schema/spec limitation, skipped, not filed.** The
   example (ported from the ProvToolbox test corpus) asserts the identifier
   `chairs:2011OctDec/0004`. PROV-XML types `prov:id`/`prov:ref` as
   `xsd:QName`, whose local part must be a valid NCName (no `/`), which is
   stricter than PROV-N's QualifiedName (arbitrary local-name characters).
   The PROV-XML spec itself documents this gap ("valid identifier values in
   PROV-N serializations have [the] potential to not be valid identifier
   values in PROV-XML", <https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-xml/>) and recommends —
   but does not require — identifier schemes that avoid it. No PROV-XML
   implementation could serialize this identifier validly; not a defect in
   this library. Documented skip in `test_xml_schema.py`
   (`QNAME_LOCAL_PART_SKIP`).
2. **`datatypes` — bug, filed #244, strict xfail.** The example asserts the
   plain Python int `123456789000` (`ex:long`). `provxml.py`'s xsd-type
   inference (`serializers/provxml.py:221-226`) maps every plain `int` to
   `XSD_INT` unconditionally, with no magnitude check, so a value outside the
   `xsd:int` range (±2^31-1) serializes as `<ex:long
   xsi:type="xsd:int">123456789000</ex:long>` — schema-invalid on its own,
   no round trip needed to observe it. Root-cause sibling of #235 (`xsd:long`
   Literals silently re-typed `xsd:int` on ingestion) but a distinct
   manifestation: this needs no explicit `XSD_LONG` annotation at all, and
   the result is invalid XML rather than merely lossy. Any fix changes
   serialized output, so it's 3.0 material under the 2.x output freeze.
   Strict xfail in `test_xml_schema.py` (`INT_MAGNITUDE_XFAIL`,
   `raises=AssertionError`).
3. **`ATTRIBUTE_VALUES[1]`/`[2]` (`Literal("un lieu", langtag="fr")` /
   `Literal("a place", langtag="en")` on `prov:type`) — schema/spec
   limitation, skipped, not filed.** `prov-core.xsd` gives only `prov:label`
   the `prov:InternationalizedString` complex type (string + optional
   `xml:lang`); `prov:type`/`prov:role`/`prov:location`/`prov:value` are all
   plain `xs:anySimpleType`, which does not permit an `xml:lang` attribute at
   all. PROV-DM permits language-tagged values on any attribute, but
   PROV-XML — by schema design — can only represent a language tag on
   `prov:label`. Not something this library's serializer could fix by
   changing how it writes `prov:type`; a genuine expressiveness gap in the
   PROV-XML format itself. Documented skip in `test_xml_schema.py`
   (`LANG_TAG_ON_NON_LABEL_SKIP`), one instance per affected index.

Not already covered by #224 (empty-string attributes dropped by PROV-XML) or
any other previously-filed issue — checked before filing #244.

Package data (`pyproject.toml` `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`,
`"prov.tests"` list) gained `"schemas/*"` so the vendored schema closure
ships in the sdist.

**Verdict:** PROV-XML output is schema-valid except: (a) identifiers whose
local part is not a valid XML NCName, which is an inherent PROV-XML format
limitation (not fixable, not filed); (b) language-tagged values on
attributes other than `prov:label`, also an inherent PROV-XML format
limitation (not fixable, not filed); and (c) plain Python integers outside
the 32-bit `xsd:int` range, which is a genuine defect in this library's XML
type-inference heuristic (filed #244, deferred to 3.0 under the output
freeze).

| [#236](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/236) | `PROV-DM conformance:` documented `prov:type` idiom for agent subtypes asserts a plain string, not the `prov:Person` type (§5.7.2.4) | §2.3 |
| [#237](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/237) | `PROV-DM conformance:` factory time parameters leak raw dateutil `ParserError` and reject the valid xsd:dateTime hour-24 form (§5.7.3) | §2.7.3 |
| [#238](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/238) | `PROV-DM conformance:` `prov:QUALIFIED_NAME`-typed Literals are not resolved to QualifiedNames, breaking round-trip equality (§5.7.3) | §2.7.3 |
| [#239](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/239) | `Bug:` `prov.read()` cannot auto-detect valid PROV-XML — RDF deserializer's `BadSyntax` propagates before the XML deserializer is tried (Phase-3 loose end, confirmed) | §2.9 |
| [#240](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/240) | `Bug:` `ProvDocument.serialize()` silently writes to a repr-named CWD file when given a non-`io.IOBase` file object (e.g. `NamedTemporaryFile`) | §2.9 |
| [#244](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/244) | `PROV-XML conformance:` plain Python ints are always typed `xsd:int`, producing schema-invalid output outside the int32 range | §3.1 |

Not filed (findings-doc only): the §2.8 validation-gap family (needs maintainer
confirmation — enforcement is a 3.0 API-philosophy decision), the `Literal` language-tag
case-sensitivity nit (§2.7.3, needs maintainer confirmation), the Mention/PROV-Links
labelling nit (§2.5), the feature gaps already recorded in section 1, and the two §3.1
PROV-XML format limitations (QName-incompatible local names; language tags on
non-`prov:label` attributes) — both are inherent to the PROV-XML schema, not
implementation defects.
## 6. Triage (step 31) — proposed → approved
| Issue | Bucket (2.x / 3.0 / backlog) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|

## Out of scope (step 32)
The PROV-CONSTRAINTS validation engine (#62 — inferences, event ordering,
typing and impossibility checks) stays on the post-3.0 features backlog.
Only the unification/merging rules that back `unified()` are in scope.
